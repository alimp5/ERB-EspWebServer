WebServer_erb

This Program Provides the following for the Esp8266 as a WebServer:  
But CAUTION, some functionallity may not have been throughly tested.  

The purpose of the program is to provide an Experimental Enviroment in which  
to create new functions that can be used in my other planned projects.  

Currently, all Arduino IDE TABS are '.ino' type files, which are compiled as a single blob.  
The structure of this progame could be better, as normally, the TABS should be set up  
as '.h', '.c', or '.cpp' files, but this is easier and quicker for my experimental efforts.  
Future revisions may be properly constructed.
